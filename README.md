# 33RPM
Building AI Course Project

## Summary

The project's goal is to provide a tool, that would allow for easier and better selection of vinyl based on your music taste/budget. Discover hidden gems spread over the internet and  find hidden gems on the second hand market.


## Background

When searching for music there is a bunch of factors to be aware of genre, length, atmosphere, price, medium, second hand or new.
DJs, music lovers, music selectors have to oversee a bunch of music, having a helping hand can speed up the process and make your selection count.
33 RPM AI advisor would provide the right information based on proper analysing your listening habbits, viewing habbits and surfing habbits. Based on that information we could provide the user with the perfect shopping list based on your budget.
We can take data from everywhere to figure out what your preferences are. Small attentions would allow the bot the change the list and/or add suggestions.


## How is it used?

The solution would be available in the form of a (browser) plugin , bot or application that tracks your behaviour and gives suggestion to allow you to shop/stream the music. 

The use itself would be very simple, fill in a questionnaire for basic profile, connect the apps that you use and let it process the data and start shopping/listening.

## Challenges

Are people agreeing with the fact that we are following them in google maps to build a profile based on places they visit to give them proper suggestions?

Privacy 

Not being able to provide the right pricing (shipment/currency/etc.)

Trying to grab a piece of the offline market.

Figuring out behaviour/mood changes.

## What next?

Standard plugin in streaming apps would be great, people will want to be sucked in in the selection so they have a great day, because music brightens their mood.

An open API that allows easy scraping of catalogues of music/vinyl shops.

Data gathering, map out possible MVP
